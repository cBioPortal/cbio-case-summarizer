{
  "cBioPortal Patient ID": "P04",
  "cBioPortal Sample ID List": "P04_Pri, P04_Rec1, P04_Rec2, P04_Rec3",
  "Clinical context": "Patient P04 is a 22-year-old male diagnosed with astrocytoma, a type of glioma, who survived for 61 months post-diagnosis.",
  "Clinical timeline": "Initial diagnosis of astrocytoma (Grade II) followed by three recurrences as anaplastic astrocytoma (Grade III). Underwent surgeries at each recurrence and received TMZ chemotherapy and radiation therapy.",
  "Molecular profile": "Mutations in IDH1 (R132C) and TP53 (R248Q) were detected. IDH1 mutation is oncogenic with OncoKB level 1, indicating a significant role in tumor biology.",
  "Study context": "The study investigates the molecular evolution and treatment responses in glioma patients, focusing on genetic and epigenetic changes over time.",
  "Patient in study": "Patient P04 exemplifies a case of glioma with multiple recurrences and provides insights into tumor evolution and resistance mechanisms.",
  "Scientific implications": "This case illustrates the persistence of IDH1 mutation across recurrences, suggesting its role as a truncal mutation. The consistent presence of TP53 mutation indicates potential clonal selection. The low TMB suggests limited neoantigen formation, possibly affecting immune evasion.",
  "Mechanisms of resistance": "Potential resistance mechanisms include clonal evolution and selection of resistant subclones harboring IDH1 and TP53 mutations.",
  "Diagnosis history": "Initially diagnosed with Grade II astrocytoma, progressed to Grade III anaplastic astrocytoma upon recurrence.",
  "Mutational signatures": "The presence of IDH1 mutation suggests a potential association with COSMIC signature 11, related to temozolomide treatment.",
  "Methylation": "MGMT methylation status is unknown, which could influence TMZ treatment efficacy. No evidence of G-CIMP erosion is noted.",
  "Treatment history": "Received TMZ chemotherapy and radiation therapy post-initial diagnosis and during recurrences.",
  "Treatment recommendation": "Consideration of alternative alkylating agents or clinical trials targeting IDH1 mutations could be beneficial.",
  "Clinical trial recommendation": "Enrollment in trials targeting IDH1 mutations or exploring novel agents for recurrent gliomas could be considered."
