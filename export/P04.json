  "cBioPortal Patient ID": "P04",
  "cBioPortal Sample ID List": "P04_Pri, P04_Rec1, P04_Rec2, P04_Rec3",
  "Clinical context": "Patient P04 is a male diagnosed with astrocytoma at age 22, which progressed to anaplastic astrocytoma over time.",
  "Clinical timeline": "Initial surgery for astrocytoma was followed by three recurrences, each treated with surgery and temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy. Radiographic progression was noted before each recurrence.",
  "Molecular profile": "The patient harbors IDH1 R132C and TP53 R248Q mutations, both considered oncogenic. The IDH1 mutation is a level 1 oncogenic driver according to OncoKB.",
  "Study context": "The study investigates the genomic evolution and treatment responses in glioma patients, focusing on the impact of IDH mutations and treatment resistance.",
  "Patient in study": "Patient P04 is part of a cohort examining the progression from lower-grade astrocytoma to anaplastic astrocytoma, highlighting the role of IDH1 mutations.",
  "Scientific implications": "This case illustrates the progression of astrocytoma to anaplastic astrocytoma, with IDH1 and TP53 mutations as potential drivers. The consistent presence of these mutations suggests their role in tumor maintenance and resistance.",
  "Mechanisms of resistance": "Potential resistance mechanisms include the persistence of IDH1 and TP53 mutations, which may contribute to treatment resistance and tumor recurrence.",
  "Diagnosis history": "Initially diagnosed with astrocytoma at age 22, the disease progressed to anaplastic astrocytoma over subsequent recurrences.",
  "Mutational signatures": "The presence of IDH1 R132C suggests a signature associated with glioma, potentially related to COSMIC signature 11.",
  "Methylation": "MGMT methylation status is unknown, which limits insights into potential epigenomic remodeling or G-CIMP status.",
  "Treatment history": "The patient underwent multiple surgeries and received temozolomide chemotherapy, with radiation therapy administered after the first recurrence.",
  "Summary": "Patient P04, a male diagnosed at 22 with astrocytoma, experienced progression to anaplastic astrocytoma, undergoing multiple surgeries and temozolomide treatments. IDH1 R132C and TP53 R248Q mutations persisted throughout, suggesting a role in resistance and progression. The study highlights the genomic evolution in glioma, focusing on IDH mutations. This case underscores the challenges of managing recurrent glioma with persistent oncogenic mutations.",
  "Treatment recommendation": "Consideration of alternative alkylating agents or combination therapies targeting IDH1 mutations may be beneficial.",
  "Clinical trial recommendation": "Enrollment in trials targeting IDH1-mutant gliomas or novel agents overcoming temozolomide resistance could be considered."
